VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Object::FromData;

        my $object = Object::FromData->new(
            {   ref => {
                    foo      => 'bar',
                    this     => 'that',
                    _private => 'no method will be created',
                    colors   => [qw/red blue green/],
                    numbers  => {
                        un    => 1,
                        deux  => 2,
                        trois => 3,
                    },
                },
            }
        );

        say $object->is_hashref;     # 1
        say $object->is_arrayref;    # 0

        say $object->foo;            # bar
        say $object->this;           # that
        say $object->_private;       # BOOM! No such method

        say $object->numbers->is_hashref;     # 0
        say $object->numbers->is_arrayref;    # 1
        say $object->numbers->deux;           # 2

        my $colors = $object->colors;
        while ( $colors->has_more ) {
            say $colors->next;    # red, blue, green on successive lines
        }

  "new"
        my $object = Object::FromData->new({ ref => $ref });

    Takes a hashref. The key of "ref" must be a hashref or arrayref. Returns
    an object. The object represents a hash or an arrayref as created by
    "Object::FromData::Hash" or "Object::FromData::Array".

    The primary purpose of this module was to be able to take arbitrary JSON
    from a client and create an object I could safely embed in another
    object.
